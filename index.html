    <a class="text">Imagine going to a networking meeting …

      You enter a room full of serious grey suits politely sipping 
      their wine, bragging about their corporate missions. Rather boringly.      
      And there you are, in your purple shirt, feeling out of place.    
      You grab a glass of beer, and tap a fork against the glass to attract attention.
      “Listen up,” you say, “let me tell you a story about how I conquered the world.”
      “Wanna hear it?”
      A business story doesn’t need bravery like that. But a good business 
      story has the same impact: You attract attention. You stand out. 
      You invigorate your audience, and pull them closer to you. They get inspired.</a>
